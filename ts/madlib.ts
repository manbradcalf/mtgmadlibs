console.log(`Hello, is this Dr ${r(creatures)}? Yes, im afraid my dog is terribly sick, Im afraid she has come down with ${(r(enchantments))}.
            Last night she was eating something from the ${r(lands)} behind my home and this morning she began to throw up what looked like a pile of ${r(artifacts)}s before pooping out what can only be described as ${r(instantsAndSorceries)}. I went to wipe her afterwards and her anal glands looked like ${(r(lands))}. I've read online about ${(r(instantsAndSorceries))} and ${(r(enchantments))} for curing dogs with severe diarrhea, do you think either of those will work?`)
